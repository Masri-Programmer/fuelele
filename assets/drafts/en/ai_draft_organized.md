## ℹ️ Introduction: We learn for life

> **Information, Founder, Past Events, Successes The Next Steps - Goal**

When **Gülten Yilmaz-Meral** started **Fülele**, her vision was manifested in a powerful guiding principle: **NON SCHOLAE SED VITAE DISCIMUS** – **"We learn not for school, but for life"**.

Her mission is to harness the radiance of this idea to help children in need and in critical life situations. Fülele is intended to be not just a name, but a movement that leaves something good behind for the weakest in our society and provides them with tools for a strong life.

## 📣 Our Mission & Goals

### Topic: Fülele

The **Fülele** Initiative [or Foundation] promotes aid projects for children and adolescents in need across Germany. Our goal is not only to provide financial support but also to draw attention to grievances and issues that receive too little notice in society.

### Media Attention for Children in Need

_(What are the goals? What should the attention focus on?)_

In addition to financial support for children's aid projects, **Fülele** is committed to ensuring that the concerns of these children receive the greatest possible media attention. We organize press appointments, appearances in local media _(Example: Stuttgarter Zeitung)_, and use events to present our funding projects and be a public voice for the weakest.
