### 🎯 Purpose of the Landing Page

The main purpose of this landing page is the **introduction and establishment of the charity project or foundation "Fülele"**. The page aims to build trust, inform visitors about the mission, and prompt them to take action.

The core goals, based on the notes in the previous section, are:

- **Introduction:** To clearly communicate what "**Fülele**" stands for, what its goals are, and who the founders (e.g., **Gülten Yilmaz-Meral**) and supporters are.
- **Fundraising:** A primary goal is collecting donations. This is evident through prominent "**Donate Now**" buttons and the provision of bank account information.
- **Transparency & Trust:** A crucial section is dedicated to the "**Legal Basis**." This shows that the page (similar to the BAMBI example) values transparency by mentioning control bodies and, if applicable, donation seals (like the DZI seal) to build credibility.
- **Media Attention:** The page is intended to help generate media attention for the topic of "**Children in Need**," similar to the example of "Appearance in local media / Stuttgarter Zeitung."

### 🎨 Design Tendencies and Structure

Based on the templates, the design should be **professional, trustworthy, and emotionally appealing**.

- **Layout:** A clear, section-based on-page design. Each section (Foundation, Projects, News, Partners, etc.) is clearly titled.
  Color palette: The new palette is clear, modern, and impactful. It's based on white (#ffffff) and a dark Raisin Black (#231f20) for body text. Pigment Green (#0fa14a) and Fire Brick (#be1d2c) serve as bold accent colors, ideal for headings, buttons, and important notices. A neutral gray (#7f8184) completes the palette for secondary information.
- **Typography:** A clean, modern, and highly legible **sans-serif font** is used in various sizes to create a clear visual hierarchy (headings, subheadings, body text).
- **Imagery:** The use of high-quality, emotional images is central. The examples show group photos, children engaging in activities, and prominent supporters (like Giovanni Zarrella). For "**Fülele**," authentic pictures of their projects or the people involved would be ideal.
- **Trust Signals:** In addition to the "**Legal Basis**" section, logos of partners and any seals received (like the DZI Donation Seal) should be prominently placed.
